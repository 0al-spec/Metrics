## Papers

1. **[SIB - Specification-Implementation Balance](SIB/metrics.pdf)** - A non-normative diagnostic framework for observing the balance between specification (intent), implementation (code), and AI inference cost in modern AI-assisted software development. Rather than proposing optimization targets or productivity metrics, the framework is designed to expose structural and economic shifts in the process of intent-to-implementation conversion.

## Building

Each paper is in its own directory with a Makefile:

```bash
cd SIB
make build   # Compile to PDF
make view    # Compile and open PDF
```
