1. [SIB - Specification-Implementation Balance](SIB/metrics.pdf) - a non-normative diagnostic framework for observing the balance between specification (intent), implementation (code), and AI inference cost in modern AI-assisted software development. Rather than proposing optimization targets or productivity metrics, the framework is designed to expose structural and economic shifts in the process of intent-to-implementation conversion.
